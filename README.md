The first known Olympics were held in summer months of 776 B.C. at Olympia in southern Greece to honor Zeus, the king of the gods. The ancient Games were last held in the 4th century. ​

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) was founded in 1894, two years before the first modern Olympics were held in 1896. The IOC currently governs the National Olympic Committees (NOC), of which there are 206 officially recognized. ​

Each country invests not only financial support but pride in the athletes who represent their people and country. I will examine various characteristics of Olympic data including performance of USSR and the subsequent 
performance of independent former-soviet countries.
